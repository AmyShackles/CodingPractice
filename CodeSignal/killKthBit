The message contains several numbers that, when typed into a supercomputer, will launch a missile into the sky

You figured out that some numbers have a modified single digit in their binary representation. 
More specifically, in the given number n the kth bit from the right was initially set to 0, 
but its current value might be different. It's now up to you to write a function that will change the kth bit of n back to 0.
